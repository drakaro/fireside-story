        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
        <p>I didn't know what to write.</p>
        <p>I need a Dark and Stormy</p>
        <p>day to think of what to say.</p>
        <p>It is getting really cold outside.</p>
        <p>So cold I think I might take a flight</p>
        <p>To somewhere far and exotic and where the stars are different.</p>
